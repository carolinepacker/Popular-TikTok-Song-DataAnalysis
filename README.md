# Overview

I am trying to expand my knowledge about Python and using the Pandas module. This was a great learning experience to ask questions about data and figure out how to analyze it using Pandas.

I used a dataset of TikTok's most popular songs from 2022. It had columns with basic information such as track name and artist name to more complex things like tempo, time signature, etc...
[TikTok Popular Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sveta151/tiktok-popular-songs-2022?resource=download)

My purpose for analyzing the data is to gain experience with Pandas. I thought using popular TikTok songs would be interesting to see the correlation between different elements of a song and what makes it popular.

# Data Analysis Results

Who are the top 5 artist in this dataset?
1. Drake
2. The Weeknd
3. Harry Styles
4. Ed Sheeran
5. Justin Bieber

What are the top 5 tracks in this dataset?
1. Glimpse of Us - Joji
2. As It Was - Harry Styles
3. Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God) - Kate Bush
4. Late Night Talking - Harry Styles
5. Jimmy Cooks (feat. 21 Savage) - Drake

What is the average valence for the most popular TikTok songs?
0.51 (0 being low valence/depressing, 1 being high valence/cheerful)

Correlation between different columns
* The user can enter in two different columns and it will return the correlation.
* Entering in different columns surprised me because not many of the columns have good correlaton.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code and GitHub for this project.

I used Python as the language and the Pandas module for the data analysis.

# Future Work

* In the user input portion I can make sure the column they entered exists in the dataset.
* Create code to make sure the data is all integers (no song names, album names, or artist names)
* I can improve the speed and efficiency of the program.
